Overall Summary of Cause Analysis (Attrition at Red Apple Technologies)
Using Six Sigma tools, the analysis of attrition causes revealed the following:
1. Measurement System Analysis (MSA)
•	Tool Used: Crossed Gage R&R (Attribute Agreement Analysis)
•	Finding: 95% agreement between HR representatives across trials.
•	Conclusion: Measurement system is reliable; attrition reasons data is trustworthy.
2. Pareto Chart
•	Top Causes:
o	Higher Studies (35%)
o	Career Growth (30%)
•	Insight: These two reasons account for 65% of attrition → the “vital few” causes.
•	Secondary Causes: Relocation (15%), Health Reasons (15%), Marriage & Business (5%).
3. Control Chart
•	Data: Monthly attrition % (Jul–Dec 2024).
•	Finding: September spike (6.19%) is an out-of-control point, linked to dissatisfaction after August performance reviews.
•	Conclusion: Attrition process is unstable, with special cause variation.
4. Yield / Z-Score
•	Yield ≈ 96.57%
•	Baseline Z ≈ 1.8 (or 3.3 with 1.5 sigma shift)
•	Conclusion: Far below Six Sigma quality (Z = 6). Improvement is essential.
5. Hypothesis Test
•	H₀: Attrition ≤ 1%
•	H₁: Attrition > 1%
•	Result: Z = 0.0547 → Accept Ha. Age of employees is correlated to the attrition rate due to career growth.
6. Why–Why Analysis
•	Resignations Root Causes:
o	Poor growth prospects (slow promotions, delayed increments in August).
o	Poor compensation compared to competitors.
o	Stressful environment & long working hours.
•	Terminations Root Causes:
•	Integrity violations due to weak governance and monitoring.
Final Cause Summary
•	Vital Causes of Attrition:
o	Career growth dissatisfaction (slow promotions, delayed increments).
o	Higher studies (employees leaving for education).
o	Poor compensation and stressful work environment.\

•	Special Causes:
•	Integrity violations (October terminations).
•	Relocation and personal reasons (minor contributors).
Next Step
Focus improvement efforts on:
1.	Career growth & promotion cycle (align with competitors).
2.	Compensation benchmarking (close the gap).
3.	Work-life balance (reduce long hours, stress).
4.	Governance policies (prevent integrity violations).
This integrated cause analysis provides a strong baseline for your Six Sigma project charter and improvement roadmap.
What kind of control measures will help the improvements to get sustained?
To make sure the improvements you design for reducing attrition are sustained over time, you’ll need to put strong control measures in place during the Control phase of DMAIC. These measures lock in the gains and prevent the process from slipping back.
Key Control Measures
1. Standardization & Documentation
•	Update HR policies to reflect new promotion cycles, compensation benchmarks, and governance rules.
•	Document clear SOPs for performance reviews, increments, and exit interview handling.
•	Ensure managers and HR staff follow standardized procedures.
2. Monitoring & Control Charts
•	Continue tracking monthly attrition using a np-Chart.
•	Set control limits and flag out-of-control points (e.g., spikes after reviews).
•	Use dashboards to visualize attrition trends and reasons.
3. KPIs & Metrics
•	Attrition % (monthly, quarterly).
•	Promotion cycle time vs. competitors.
•	Average working hours per employee.
•	Integrity violations logged and resolved.
•	Employee satisfaction survey scores.
4. Preventive Controls
•	Automate alerts for employees crossing thresholds (e.g., tenure without promotion).
•	Introduce governance checks (system monitoring for misuse, audits).
•	Regular compensation benchmarking against competitors.
5. Feedback & Audits
•	Quarterly HR audits to verify compliance with new processes.
•	Employee pulse surveys to capture dissatisfaction early.
•	Exit interview consistency checks (MSA repeatability maintained).
Sustaining the Gains
•	Ownership: Assign process owners (HR head + project managers).
•	Training: Train HR staff and managers on new policies and Six Sigma basics.
•	Governance: Embed attrition reduction targets into performance scorecards.
•	Continuous Improvement: Schedule quarterly reviews to refine solutions as new data emerges.
This way, the improvements don’t just fix attrition temporarily but become part of the company’s operating rhythm.
